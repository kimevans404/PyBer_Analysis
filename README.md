# PyBer Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
V. Isualize would like an analysis on ride-sharing by city type. Using Pandas and Matplotlib, a dataframe and a multiple-line graph will show the total weekly fares for each city type: Urban, Suburban, and Rural. 

## Results
Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

The data to analyze was provided in two files that were combined to pull the following summary:

This chart shows some information that is expected such as seeing more urban rides than rural rides, and also more urban drivers compared to the number of drivers in suburban and rural cities. One thing to note is that the number of drivers in urban cities surpasses the number of rides, showing that there should be no shortage of drivers when a ride is needed in an urban city. Using this chart we can determine that the larger number of drivers in the urban cities negatively affects the amount made per driver. While the average urban fare is lower as compared to suburban and rural fare, the average fare per urban driver is much lower because there is a higher demand for drivers in rural cities. 

Next, let's look at a chart showing each city type's collected fares in weekly increments.

This chart shows that while the total fares goes up and down over the first 4 months of the year, each city type stays within a small range. The only week that all three city types saw a similar spike in rides was the last week of February 2019. The main things that could have contributed to the increase of rides were The Oscars, the festivals of Carnaval, or Spring Break.

## Summary
Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
